# UserBehaviorInApplication
In this project, we will build a sales funnel and study user behavior patterns in a food company's application.
Also, the designers of the application would like to change the fonts, but the managers are afraid that users will find the new design intimidating.
Therefore, A/A/B tests were carried out and we will look at their results and offer a solution.

**Data Analysis Process:**
- Data preparing
- EDA
- AB testing
- Test hypothesis
